*Last updated: 21 Nov 2025*

## Subscriptions (monthly/annual)
- Full refund if requested within 14 days and fewer than 3 detections used.
- Beyond that or with more usage, the current period is not refundable.

## One-time / Lifetime
- Refund if requested within 14 days and no usage recorded.
- If there was usage, no refund.

## How to request
Email **support@detectordeia.pro** from your account email (or clearly state it). We check usage; if eligible, we refund to the original method.

## Timing & exceptions
Processing time depends on your bank/provider. We may deny refunds in abuse cases (repeated purchases/refunds, heavy use then refund). You can always cancel future renewals; periods already started are not refunded except as above.
- EU consumers: if you ask us to start the service immediately, you agree that the right of withdrawal may end once the digital service has been fully or substantially provided (e.g., if you already used the detections allowed during the 14‑day window).

          "item-1": {
            "question": "Is VeriIA’s word counter really free?",
            "answer": "Yes. VeriIA’s word counter is a free tool: you can paste your text and see words, characters, and reading time without creating an account or spending credits."
          },
          "item-2": {
            "question": "Does my text get sent to VeriIA’s servers when I use the word counter?",
            "answer": "No. The word counter runs directly in your browser: your text is processed locally and is not stored or sent to our servers."
          },
          "item-3": {
            "question": "What does the word counter measure besides word count?",
            "answer": "In addition to words, VeriIA’s word counter shows characters with and without spaces, the number of sentences and paragraphs, and an approximate reading time in minutes."
          },
          "item-4": {
            "question": "Why does the word counter show a different number than Word or Google Docs?",
            "answer": "Because each tool uses slightly different rules to define a “word”. Some counters include numbers, URLs, or certain formatted elements and others don’t, so small differences are normal."
          },
          "item-5": {
            "question": "What counts as a “word” in an online word counter?",
            "answer": "Typically, a word is any group of characters separated by spaces or punctuation. Numbers, hashtags, or links can be counted as a single word depending on the word counter."
          },
          "item-6": {
            "question": "How can I estimate how many pages X words will be?",
            "answer": "First, use the word counter to get the total word count. As a rough guide, 250–300 words is about one page double-spaced at 12 pt, and around 500 words is one single-spaced page."
          },
          "item-7": {
            "question": "How is reading time calculated in the word counter?",
            "answer": "The word counter estimates reading time by dividing the total number of words by an average reading speed, for example 200–250 words per minute. It helps you see if an article or newsletter is longer than your audience expects."
          },
          "item-8": {
            "question": "Does the word counter work well with any language?",
            "answer": "It works best with languages that separate words using spaces, like English or Spanish. In texts with many symbols or in languages without clear spaces, there can be small variations."
          },
          "item-9": {
            "question": "Is there a practical length limit for using the online word counter?",
            "answer": "In practice, the limit is set by your browser and available memory. For very long manuscripts, it’s usually easier to split the content into sections and run each part through the word counter."
          },
          "item-10": {
            "question": "When does it make sense to use an online word counter instead of Word or Google Docs?",
            "answer": "When you want a quick check without opening a document, when you work across many formats, or when you need extra metrics like reading time. It’s an extra layer of control on top of your regular editor."

            "question": "Why can two text compare tools show different results for the same documents?",

It leans on the same arguments, recycles connectors like \"on the other hand\" and avoids concrete details, resulting in a pleasant yet predictable structure. Use it to see how the AI detector behaves with clearly synthetic text and to view the sentence-level highlights.",
        "humanArticle": "As Apple and Google transform their voice assistants into chatbots, OpenAI is transforming its chatbot into a voice assistant.\nOn Monday, the San Francisco artificial intelligence start-up unveiled a new version of its ChatGPT chatbot that can receive and respond to voice commands, images and videos.\n“We are looking at the future of the interaction between ourselves and machines,” said Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer.",
        "mixedEmail": "AI content detection systems are crucial tools for online platforms and businesses to utilize as they allow for the automated identification and screening of harmful, illegal, sensitive or copyrighted material at large scales, helping to remove such content from circulation faster and prevent its spread. Specifically, AI detectors can help find child abuse images, terrorist propaganda, spam, private personal details, misinformation, graphic violence, harassment and illegally posted copyrighted content. This enforcement of community guidelines and legal standards through AI screening upholds safety, privacy, integrity and authenticity online while also respecting intellectual property – ultimately benefiting both users and organizations."

        "item-2": {
          "question": "How does the AI detector work in broad strokes?",
          "answer": "The AI detector analyzes structure, rhythm, repetition, and word choice and compares them against human and AI examples. It then outputs a global probability and highlights sections worth reviewing. It evaluates style, not isolated words."

        "item-3": {
          "question": "How accurate is the AI detector? Can it be wrong?",
          "answer": "It is probabilistic, not an absolute verdict. In most cases the AI detector is a useful signal, but false positives and false negatives can happen. Use it as one input among others, not as the only decision maker."

        "item-4": {
          "question": "How should I read the percentage and highlights?",
          "answer": "The percentage shows how much the overall text resembles AI writing. It does not mean that exact percent of the text is AI. Highlights point to sentences or paragraphs with more AI-like style so you can review them more carefully."
        },
        "item-5": {
          "question": "What is the minimum length and which file formats are supported?",
          "answer": "We recommend at least 30–50 words for more stable AI detector results. You can paste text or upload .docx and plain text formats like .txt. Very short fragments are less reliable for any detector."
        },
        "item-6": {
          "question": "Which languages does the AI detector support right now?",

          "question": "Is there a free plan for the AI detector? What are the limits?",

        },
        "item-8": {
          "question": "What happens to my texts? Do you store or train on them?",
          "answer": "We do not permanently store your texts or use them to train our models or third-party models. We only process the content to generate the AI detector report and do not share it with other tools."
        },
        "item-9": {
          "question": "Does the AI detector work with mixed or paraphrased texts?",
          "answer": "Yes. The AI detector can analyze texts with both human and AI parts, or paraphrased drafts. The result reflects the overall style—the more you edit and personalize, the further it moves away from typical AI patterns."
        },
        "item-10": {
          "question": "What if I am sure my text is original but the AI detector flags it as AI?",
          "answer": "Remember that the AI detector gives an estimate, not a legal verdict. Keep drafts, notes, and edit history as evidence of your process. Use the report as a starting point for discussions with teachers, clients, or reviewers, not as a substitute for human judgment."

## Subscriptions (monthly/annual)
- Full refund if requested within 14 days and fewer than 3 detections used.
- Beyond that or with more usage, the current period is not refundable.

## One-time / Lifetime
- Refund if requested within 14 days and no usage recorded.
- If there was usage, no refund.

## How to request
Email **support@detectordeia.pro** from your account email (or clearly state it). We check usage; if eligible, we refund to the original method.

## Timing & exceptions
Processing time depends on your bank/provider. We may deny refunds in abuse cases (repeated purchases/refunds, heavy use then refund). You can always cancel future renewals; periods already started are not refunded except as above.

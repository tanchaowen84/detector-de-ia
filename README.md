# VeriIA — Spanish AI Content Detector

VeriIA helps you quickly tell whether Spanish text was written by humans or generated by AI. Paste text, upload a document, or scan a URL, and get an instant probability score plus sentence‑level highlights that show exactly where AI patterns appear.

## What you get
- **One‑click detection**: Text box, file upload, or URL input—choose the source and run.
- **Clear verdicts**: Overall AI probability (%) and a concise English takeaway (More likely AI / Mixed / More likely human).
- **Sentence heatmap**: Each sentence is color‑graded by AI likelihood so you know where to focus.
- **Context hints**: Short rationale on why the text looks AI‑generated (repetition, style cues, etc.).
- **Attack awareness**: Flags common obfuscation tricks (zero‑width spaces, homoglyphs) to keep reports honest.
- **Privacy‑first**: Content is analyzed only for detection; it isn’t reused for training or shared.

## Who it’s for
- **Students & educators**: Check essays, assignments, and thesis drafts.
- **Universities & schools**: Spot AI‑heavy submissions at scale.
- **Writers, bloggers, SEO teams**: Validate originality before publishing.
- **Compliance & reviewers**: Verify sensitive or high‑stakes documents.

## Architecture snapshot
- **App**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React + TypeScript; Spanish default with English fallback.
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4 + Radix UI; sentence highlights driven by Winston scores.
- **AI Detection**: Winston AI Detector API v2 (per‑sentence scoring, attack flags).
- **Auth & sessions**: Better Auth with Google/GitHub providers.
- **Data**: Postgres via Drizzle ORM; records detections, credits, and payment events.
- **Payments**: Creem for subscriptions/one‑time packs; Stripe kept disabled for later.

## How deployment works (the only tech you need)
1) Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` and fill your keys (Winston API, auth provider, billing, storage, email).
2) Install dependencies and start the app: `pnpm install` then `pnpm dev`.
3) For production, run `pnpm build` and `pnpm start`, or deploy to Vercel with the same environment variables.

## How detection works (plain language)
1) You submit text, a document, or a URL.
2) VeriIA asks the Winston detector for an AI probability and sentence scores.
3) Credits are consumed based on the length of what you analyze.
4) The result shows an overall score, per‑sentence highlights, and a short conclusion you can share.

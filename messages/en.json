            "question": "Do citations or the bibliography show up as matches?",

          "item-1": {
            "question": "Is VeriIA’s word counter really free?",
            "answer": "Yes. VeriIA’s word counter is a free tool: you can paste your text and see words, characters, and reading time without creating an account or spending credits."
          },
          "item-2": {
            "question": "Does my text get sent to VeriIA’s servers when I use the word counter?",
            "answer": "No. The word counter runs directly in your browser: your text is processed locally and is not stored or sent to our servers."
          },
          "item-3": {
            "question": "What does the word counter measure besides word count?",
            "answer": "In addition to words, VeriIA’s word counter shows characters with and without spaces, the number of sentences and paragraphs, and an approximate reading time in minutes."
          },
          "item-4": {
            "question": "Why does the word counter show a different number than Word or Google Docs?",
            "answer": "Because each tool uses slightly different rules to define a “word”. Some counters include numbers, URLs, or certain formatted elements and others don’t, so small differences are normal."
          },
          "item-5": {
            "question": "What counts as a “word” in an online word counter?",
            "answer": "Typically, a word is any group of characters separated by spaces or punctuation. Numbers, hashtags, or links can be counted as a single word depending on the word counter."
          },
          "item-6": {
            "question": "How can I estimate how many pages X words will be?",
            "answer": "First, use the word counter to get the total word count. As a rough guide, 250–300 words is about one page double-spaced at 12 pt, and around 500 words is one single-spaced page."
          },
          "item-7": {
            "question": "How is reading time calculated in the word counter?",
            "answer": "The word counter estimates reading time by dividing the total number of words by an average reading speed, for example 200–250 words per minute. It helps you see if an article or newsletter is longer than your audience expects."
          },
          "item-8": {
            "question": "Does the word counter work well with any language?",
            "answer": "It works best with languages that separate words using spaces, like English or Spanish. In texts with many symbols or in languages without clear spaces, there can be small variations."
          },
          "item-9": {
            "question": "Is there a practical length limit for using the online word counter?",
            "answer": "In practice, the limit is set by your browser and available memory. For very long manuscripts, it’s usually easier to split the content into sections and run each part through the word counter."
          },
          "item-10": {
            "question": "When does it make sense to use an online word counter instead of Word or Google Docs?",
            "answer": "When you want a quick check without opening a document, when you work across many formats, or when you need extra metrics like reading time. It’s an extra layer of control on top of your regular editor."

            "question": "Why can two text compare tools show different results for the same documents?",

        "mixedEmail": "AI content detection systems are crucial tools for online platforms and businesses to utilize as they allow for the automated identification and screening of harmful, illegal, sensitive or copyrighted material at large scales, helping to remove such content from circulation faster and prevent its spread. Specifically, AI detectors can help find child abuse images, terrorist propaganda, spam, private personal details, misinformation, graphic violence, harassment and illegally posted copyrighted content. This enforcement of community guidelines and legal standards through AI screening upholds safety, privacy, integrity and authenticity online while also respecting intellectual property – ultimately benefiting both users and organizations."

        "item-2": {
          "question": "How does the AI detector work in broad strokes?",
          "answer": "The AI detector analyzes structure, rhythm, repetition, and word choice and compares them against human and AI examples. It then outputs a global probability and highlights sections worth reviewing. It evaluates style, not isolated words."

        "item-3": {
          "question": "How accurate is the AI detector? Can it be wrong?",
          "answer": "It is probabilistic, not an absolute verdict. In most cases the AI detector is a useful signal, but false positives and false negatives can happen. Use it as one input among others, not as the only decision maker."
        },
        "item-4": {
          "question": "How should I read the percentage and highlights?",
          "answer": "The percentage shows how much the overall text resembles AI writing. It does not mean that exact percent of the text is AI. Highlights point to sentences or paragraphs with more AI-like style so you can review them more carefully."
        },
        "item-5": {
          "question": "What is the minimum length and which file formats are supported?",
          "answer": "We recommend at least 30–50 words for more stable AI detector results. You can paste text or upload .docx and plain text formats like .txt. Very short fragments are less reliable for any detector."
        },
        "item-6": {
          "question": "Which languages does the AI detector support right now?",

          "question": "Is there a free plan for the AI detector? What are the limits?",

        },
        "item-8": {
          "question": "What happens to my texts? Do you store or train on them?",
          "answer": "We do not permanently store your texts or use them to train our models or third-party models. We only process the content to generate the AI detector report and do not share it with other tools."
        },
        "item-9": {
          "question": "Does the AI detector work with mixed or paraphrased texts?",
          "answer": "Yes. The AI detector can analyze texts with both human and AI parts, or paraphrased drafts. The result reflects the overall style—the more you edit and personalize, the further it moves away from typical AI patterns."
        },
        "item-10": {
          "question": "What if I am sure my text is original but the AI detector flags it as AI?",
          "answer": "Remember that the AI detector gives an estimate, not a legal verdict. Keep drafts, notes, and edit history as evidence of your process. Use the report as a starting point for discussions with teachers, clients, or reviewers, not as a substitute for human judgment."

You paste a DOI/ISBN/URL or type in the basic source details, and the APA Citation Generator builds the full reference and in-text citation for you."

            "question": "Is the APA Citation Generator free? Do I need an account?",
            "answer": "Yes. This APA Citation Generator is completely free to use. You don’t need to register, log in or add any payment details—just open the page, enter your sources and generate as many APA citations as you need."

          "item-3": {
            "question": "Which version of APA style does the tool use?",
            "answer": "The APA Citation Generator uses the 7th edition of the APA Publication Manual, which is the current standard for most universities and journals. If your institution requires small adjustments, you can use the generated APA citation as a starting point and tweak it."
          },
          "item-4": {
            "question": "What types of sources can I cite with the APA Citation Generator?",
            "answer": "Right now you can cite books, journal articles and web pages or online articles. These are the source types most students and researchers need, and the APA Citation Generator focuses on getting these right."
          },
          "item-5": {
            "question": "Does the APA Citation Generator create both references and in-text citations?",
            "answer": "Yes. For every source you add, the APA Citation Generator shows a full reference list entry and an in-text citation in author–year format, so you don’t have to figure out the pattern yourself."
          },
          "item-6": {
            "question": "How accurate are the citations? Should I still check them?",
            "answer": "The APA Citation Generator aims to follow APA 7 as closely as possible, whether you enter sources manually or via DOI/ISBN/URL. That said, it’s always a good idea to double-check names, dates and special rules your department or journal may have."
          },

            "question": "What happens if I paste a DOI/ISBN/URL and nothing is found?",

          },
          "item-8": {
            "question": "How does the APA Citation Generator handle no author, no date or many authors?",
            "answer": "The APA Citation Generator follows APA 7 rules: for no author it uses the title in place of the author, for no date it uses “n.d.”, and for many authors it supports up to 20 and applies et al. in citations when required."
          },
          "item-9": {
            "question": "Does the APA Citation Generator store my texts or my sources?",

            "question": "What types of content can I summarize with the AI Summarizer?",
            "answer": "You can paste text directly, add a URL or upload text files (for example .txt, markdown or JSON). The AI Summarizer converts everything to plain text before generating the summary. If you work with PDFs or images, you will first need to extract the text or use a web page where the content is accessible."
          },
          "item-2": {
            "question": "How much text can I paste or upload at once?",
            "answer": "Each summary has a character limit to keep quality and response time under control. If you paste a very long text, the AI Summarizer will warn you before processing so you can trim it or split it into parts. As a reference, the limit is usually enough for articles, long emails and reasonable-length chapters."
          },
          "item-3": {
            "question": "Does the AI Summarizer keep the original language and tone?",
            "answer": "Yes. We automatically detect the input language and return the summary in that same language. The AI Summarizer aims to preserve the author’s tone, intent and main nuances while mostly reducing length and repetition."
          },
          "item-4": {
            "question": "Can the AI Summarizer invent or change information?",
            "answer": "The goal of the AI Summarizer is to condense what is already in your content, not to invent new facts. That said, no model is perfect: it may simplify some ideas too much or miss a nuance. For sensitive texts (legal, medical, contracts, etc.) we recommend always reviewing the key parts of the original before making decisions."
          },
          "item-5": {
            "question": "Is it safe to use the AI Summarizer with private or sensitive documents?",
            "answer": "Yes. The AI Summarizer processes your content temporarily only to generate the result and then discards it. We do not store your texts or summaries, we do not build reading histories and we do not use your documents to train our own models. Even so, if your organization has strict policies, always check its internal rules."
          },
          "item-6": {
            "question": "Can I use the AI Summarizer for academic work without plagiarism issues?",
            "answer": "A summary is still based on someone else’s ideas, so in academic contexts you should always cite the original source. The AI Summarizer helps you understand and condense material, but it does not replace your own writing or your institution’s citation rules. To stay safe, rewrite in your own words and add the proper references."
          },
          "item-7": {
            "question": "What happens if I try to summarize a URL behind a login or paywall?",
            "answer": "The AI Summarizer needs to access the page content. If the URL is behind a login, paywall or very restricted environment, the model will likely not be able to read it. In those cases, the most reliable option is to copy the text manually and paste it directly into the tool."
          },
          "item-8": {
            "question": "How can I control the length and level of detail of the summary?",
            "answer": "You can adjust the length by moving the slider from short to long before running the AI Summarizer. If the result feels too shallow or too dense, just change the slider position and summarize again until the level of detail matches what you need."
          },
          "item-9": {
            "question": "Is the AI Summarizer free? How do credits work?",
            "answer": "You can use the AI Summarizer for free with a simple credit system: each input character consumes 0.001 credit. Without creating an account you have 200 credits, and when you sign up you get 800 additional credits. Under normal use this lets you create many summaries without paying or entering a card."
          },
          "item-10": {
            "question": "Which other VeriIA tools work well with the AI Summarizer?",
            "answer": "After using the AI Summarizer, you can send the result to other VeriIA tools depending on your case: the AI Detector helps you check if a text sounds too machine-generated, the Plagiarism Detector lets you review the originality of long work, and the APA Citation Generator creates references when you summarize academic articles or papers."
